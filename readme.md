### About Glitch Predictor
Glitch predictor was a project known by many, with around 16k users in little over a week. I am the developer of it, or was before it was shut down due to complications and overall stress.

### Pluton/Vyor
Mah, the developer of Pluton/Vyor (he recently revamped it), joined the team to help boost efforts. He did virtually nothing for the bot, his API is easily recreatable but he made it out to be more than it is. He copied my source code while we worked together and after we fell out, he used it and claimed it as "Pluton V4". This is total bullshit, as I have proof it's my code and he just threw it onto a new bot application.

Proof he used my code, as the designs are the same, especially the responses (you can see this in the code).

Him revamping it after being embarrassed, as well as being called out for randomization, blackmail, and harassment of minors using their personal information.
